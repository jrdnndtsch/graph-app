From our sponsors to our learners to the thousands of volunteers who teach in communities across Canada -- Ladies Learning Code is, and always will be, a community-driven organization.</p><p>Together we have come so far, but there is much work yet to be done. This next year will be another big one for Ladies Learning Code, and we will need our community more than ever.</p><p>Digital literacy for women and youth is rapidly gaining attention in the tech community, in education circles, and even on public agendas. Now is the time to capitalize on this incredible groundswell of support for our shared vision and make lasting change.</p>"
